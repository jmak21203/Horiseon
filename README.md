# Horiseon

Work completed on the HTML to include more semantic elements. This included ensuring allignments and spacing was correct.
    There was an abundance of <div> use throughout the code. Replaced with more appropriate elements to better illustrate the intentions of the code. 

Icon and Image elements added where necessary
ALT attributes added
Header and Footer elements added
Concise, descriptive title added
